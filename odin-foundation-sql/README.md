This was an ODIN school project where I leveraged basic SQL to analyze actor participation, movie rental patterns, genre preferences, and award-winning contributions within the Maven Movies dataset.
Developed SQL queries to retrieve specific data from a relational database using fundamental SQL commands such as SELECT, WHERE, FROM, ORDER BY, and JOINs.

Task:

Write a SQL query to count the number of characters except for the spaces for each actor. Return the first 10 actors' name lengths along with their names.

List all Oscar awardees(Actors who received the Oscar award) with their full names and the length of their names.

Find the actors who have acted in the film ‘Frost Head.’

Pull all the films acted by the actor ‘Will Wilson.’

Pull all the films which were rented and return them in the month of May.

Pull all the films with ‘Comedy’ category.
